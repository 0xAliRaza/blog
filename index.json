[{"content":"If you\u0026rsquo;re intense at loving others despite their reciprocation, congratulations, we\u0026rsquo;re alike in this regard. I don\u0026rsquo;t know how it happened and what\u0026rsquo;s the reason behind it but over the past couple of years, I\u0026rsquo;ve become quite conscious about the way I act, communicate, lead my life, or most importantly, the way I love. I have sat with my thoughts and emotions for a long long time. There have been nights when I did nothing but lay there, in the pitch dark and just observe everything. No wonders why I have gotten so good at observing.\nOne of the things I have realized is that there are just a few people out there who love relentlessly, passionately, without a condition. Loving is an art and most people, especially men, don\u0026rsquo;t know it! I mean, not to sound sexist but traits such as nurturance, sensitivity, sweetness, supportiveness, gentleness, warmth, passivity, cooperativeness, expressiveness, modesty, humility, empathy, affection, tenderness, and being emotional, kind, helpful, devoted, and understanding have been cited as stereotypically feminine (source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femininity). Now, I don\u0026rsquo;t consider myself from those who\u0026rsquo;re good at it. Perhaps I suck at it as well. But I do have feminine traits when it comes to loving others. I openly show affection and am quite expressive about it I get worried when someone who\u0026rsquo;s even just a little close to me is suffering. I can\u0026rsquo;t see them go through pain. I try so hard to be there, give them all the love I have, and treat them like they\u0026rsquo;re the last loveable person alive. And ohh, what do I get in return??\nIt\u0026rsquo;s as if I\u0026rsquo;m constantly filling their cups when my own cup is empty. I\u0026rsquo;m not ashamed of this. Nor I\u0026rsquo;d want to change it. I\u0026rsquo;m not ashamed that I trust people, that I care about them, that I think about them at 4 fucking AM and smile. I rather feel good because of this trait. This doesn\u0026rsquo;t need fixing.\nIf you have struggled with low self-esteem, anxiety, or anything of that source you\u0026rsquo;d know that loving yourself is hard. Loving is hard as hell when you aren\u0026rsquo;t proud of how you\u0026rsquo;ve acted in the past. It\u0026rsquo;s hard when you aren\u0026rsquo;t the person you ought to become. I know what you\u0026rsquo;re thinking, forgiving yourself is the answer, right? But is it that easy? Is it easy to forgive yourself? Certainly not. Forgiving others is way easier than forgiving yourself! But it\u0026rsquo;s a continuous process. It constantly takes effort. You gotta keep trying no matter how many times you fail. The answer is not to forgive yourself once but to make it a habit.\nLet me ask you this, have you ever been in love? It doesn\u0026rsquo;t just have to be romantic love, it could be platonic as well. Have you ever loved someone and been aware of it? Isn\u0026rsquo;t it beautiful when all you want to talk about is this one fucking person? The one you think about before going to bed and waking up. Wouldn\u0026rsquo;t it be heavenly to have someone love you like that? To think about you all the time, to care about you, to worry about you, to wish you all the happiness in this world for you and act like it? If you\u0026rsquo;re lucky enough (which most of us aren\u0026rsquo;t) you might end up getting that certain someone in your life. But miracles don\u0026rsquo;t happen in this world. You\u0026rsquo;re probably not going to get someone like that.\nBut what\u0026rsquo;s the answer then?\nI know there are more questions in this entry than answers. But questions make you think and thinking brings conclusions.\nI like journaling. I like writing in general. Again, it makes you think hard\u0026hellip; This is just a place (apart from the physical journal I have) where I like to convert my messy thoughts into words. Or at least, I try to. The thing is my body aches while writing this. I observed people who I care about the most. I wanted them to ask me how I was doing. I wanted them to care about me. To worry about me. But that didn\u0026rsquo;t go well üåö. Perhaps people just ask you how you are as a formality after you\u0026rsquo;ve asked them this first.\nI learn something new every day and the more I learn, the less I trust people. Though I will not stop loving them, but I sure the hell will prioritize myself over them from now on. I mean wouldn\u0026rsquo;t it just be beautiful if you were able to love yourself like someone you love the most? That includes forgiving yourself, being kind to yourself, taking care of yourself, accepting your flaws with open arms, and most importantly, valuing yourself over everyone else. I don\u0026rsquo;t think that makes you selfish. Even if it does, it\u0026rsquo;s only healthy.\n","permalink":"https://blog.0xali.com/posts/to-love-yourself-like-you-love-others/","summary":"If you\u0026rsquo;re intense at loving others despite their reciprocation, congratulations, we\u0026rsquo;re alike in this regard.

It just never made sense to me. We are not perfect in any way, neither physically, nor mentally. It\u0026rsquo;s as if we weren\u0026rsquo;t supposed to evolve into what we\u0026rsquo;ve become today. This environment, this capitalism and the political mess all around us is just toxic for us in so many ways. Collectively, all these things create unnecessary suffering in our lives and it\u0026rsquo;s as if this gigantic ball is being filled with negative energies and it\u0026rsquo;s gonna explode anytime soon. That\u0026rsquo;ll be the end that I am eagerly waiting for I guess.\nEarlier this year when my doctor told me about my loose LES, I was kinda outraged at the absurdity of life for a second. I asked him about Nissen Fundoplication or LINX treatment but he told me that it\u0026rsquo;s not that loose and if we do the surgery I\u0026rsquo;m gonna have difficulty with swallowing food. It was so funny. What he simply meant was that I was bound to suffer üíÄ, there\u0026rsquo;s no way out of it. ‚ÄúWhy did it happen to me? What did I do wrong?‚Äù, I asked. ‚ÄúWhat should we say to cancer patients when they ask the same questions?‚Äù, he replied. That made me feel like smoking weed on the top of a mountain while contemplating on this one line ‚ÄúWhat did Cancer patients do wrong?‚Äù.\nMillion other wrong things with humans, their bodies, brains and humanity in general but the thing that irks me the most is this engraved need of socializing in our biology. Let\u0026rsquo;s face it, humans can get pretty toxic at time. I have had my share of toxic ones so now I just don\u0026rsquo;t like them in general. I am not proud of this nor I am ashamed. There\u0026rsquo;s no denying that we, as a species, are inherently social. If we go against our biology then there are some serious consequences we have to face. Believe me, when I say ‚Äúserious consequences‚Äù, I speak from experience. I lived in an isolated apartment for two months once and you don\u0026rsquo;t wanna know the consequences  ü§°. If only I could change one thing about our biology, it would have been removal of the biological need for socializing.\nUghh I have always wanted to write about this. Finally I got the chance to do so in this beautiful foggy (smoggy tbvh¬†ü•≤) night at 4AM.\nSometimes I just wish I was a cat. Cats are just so majestic. They\u0026rsquo;re self sufficient, they cuddle, they lick, they have fur, they meow and they\u0026rsquo;re pretty straightforward/blunt as far as I understand. On the other hand, there are humans. Humans who yearn to be loved but never accept love, humans who betray, hurt, and get bored of others after chasing them. No wonder Egyptians prayed cats. If only humans were like cats I would have liked them as well.\nDespite my prejudice against the humanity, there are still some that I absolutely adore. With experience you just learn to filter out the good ones. But there\u0026rsquo;s no guarantee that you\u0026rsquo;ll not end up with a toxic one again. You\u0026rsquo;ll most certainly get hurt from time to time (like me). But that\u0026rsquo;s life I guess, gotta embrace the suffering and pain to survive.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know if it this fits here or not but I have always related with Meursault from Camus\u0026rsquo;s The Stranger. So here\u0026rsquo;s my favorite quote that kinda encompasses how I felt while writing this.\n ‚ÄúIt was as if that great rush of anger had washed me clean, emptied me of hope, and, gazing up at the dark sky spangled with its signs and stars, for the first time, the first, I laid my heart open to the benign indifference of the universe. To feel it so like myself, indeed, so brotherly, made me realize that I\u0026rsquo;d been happy, and that I was happy still. For all to be accomplished, for me to feel less lonely, all that remained to hope was that on the day of my execution there should be a huge crowd of spectators and that they should greet me with howls of execration.‚Äù ‚Äï Albert Camus, The Stranger\n ","permalink":"https://blog.0xali.com/posts/if-only-i-could-change/","summary":"I have never agreed with those who say things like ‚ÄúGod has made us perfect‚Äù.
