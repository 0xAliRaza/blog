It just never made sense to me. We are not perfect in any way, neither physically, nor mentally. It’s as if we weren’t supposed to evolve into what we’ve become today. This environment, this capitalism and the political mess all around us is just toxic for us in so many ways. Collectively, all these things create unnecessary suffering in our lives and it’s as if this gigantic ball is being filled with negative energies and it’s gonna explode anytime soon. That’ll be the end that I am eagerly waiting for I guess.\nEarlier this year when my doctor told me about my loose LES, I was kinda outraged at the absurdity of life for a second. I asked him about Nissen Fundoplication or LINX treatment but he told me that it’s not that loose and if we do the surgery I’m gonna have difficulty with swallowing food. It was so funny. What he simply meant was that I was bound to suffer 💀, there’s no way out of it. “Why did it happen to me? What did I do wrong?”, I asked. “What should we say to cancer patients when they ask the same questions?”, he replied. That made me feel like smoking weed on the top of a mountain while contemplating on this one line “What did Cancer patients do wrong?”.\nMillion other wrong things with humans, their bodies, brains and humanity in general but the thing that irks me the most is this engraved need of socializing in our biology. Let’s face it, humans can get pretty toxic at time. I have had my share of toxic ones so now I just don’t like them in general. I am not proud of this nor I am ashamed. There’s no denying that we, as a species, are inherently social. If we go against our biology then there are some serious consequences we have to face. Believe me, when I say “serious consequences”, I speak from experience. I lived in an isolated apartment for two months once and you don’t wanna know the consequences  🤡. If only I could change one thing about our biology, it would have been removal of the biological need for socializing.\nUghh I have always wanted to write about this. Finally I got the chance to do so in this beautiful foggy (smoggy tbvh 🥲) night at 4AM.\nSometimes I just wish I was a cat. Cats are just so majestic. They’re self sufficient, they cuddle, they lick, they have fur, they meow and they’re pretty straightforward/blunt as far as I understand. On the other hand, there are humans. Humans who yearn to be loved but never accept love, humans who betray, hurt, and get bored of others after chasing them. No wonder Egyptians prayed cats. If only humans were like cats I would have liked them as well.\nDespite my prejudice against the humanity, there are still some that I absolutely adore. With experience you just learn to filter out the good ones. But there’s no guarantee that you’ll not end up with a toxic one again. You’ll most certainly get hurt from time to time (like me). But that’s life I guess, gotta embrace the suffering and pain to survive.\nI don’t know if it this fits here or not but I have always related with Meursault from Camus’s The Stranger. So here’s my favorite quote that kinda encompasses how I felt while writing this.\n “It was as if that great rush of anger had washed me clean, emptied me of hope, and, gazing up at the dark sky spangled with its signs and stars, for the first time, the first, I laid my heart open to the benign indifference of the universe. To feel it so like myself, indeed, so brotherly, made me realize that I’d been happy, and that I was happy still. For all to be accomplished, for me to feel less lonely, all that remained to hope was that on the day of my execution there should be a huge crowd of spectators and that they should greet me with howls of execration.” ― Albert Camus, The Stranger\n ","wordCount":"704","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-11-02T00:53:04.664Z","dateModified":"2022-11-02T00:53:04.664Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Ali Raza"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://blog.0xali.com/posts/if-only-i-could-change/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Ali Raza","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://blog.0xali.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script>
