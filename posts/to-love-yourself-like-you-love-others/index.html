I donâ€™t know how it happened and whatâ€™s the reason behind it but over the past couple of years, Iâ€™ve become quite conscious about the way I act, communicate, lead my life, or most importantly, the way I love. I have sat with my thoughts and emotions for a long long time. There have been nights when I did nothing but lay there, in the pitch dark and just observe everything. No wonders why I have gotten so good at observing.\nOne of the things I have realized is that there are just a few people out there who love relentlessly, passionately, without a condition. Loving is an art and most people, especially men, donâ€™t know it! I mean, not to sound sexist but traits such as nurturance, sensitivity, sweetness, supportiveness, gentleness, warmth, passivity, cooperativeness, expressiveness, modesty, humility, empathy, affection, tenderness, and being emotional, kind, helpful, devoted, and understanding have been cited as stereotypically feminine (source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femininity). Now, I donâ€™t consider myself from those whoâ€™re good at it. Perhaps I suck at it as well. But I do have feminine traits when it comes to loving others. I openly show affection and am quite expressive about it I get worried when someone whoâ€™s even just a little close to me is suffering. I canâ€™t see them go through pain. I try so hard to be there, give them all the love I have, and treat them like theyâ€™re the last loveable person alive. And ohh, what do I get in return??\nItâ€™s as if Iâ€™m constantly filling their cups when my own cup is empty. Iâ€™m not ashamed of this. Nor Iâ€™d want to change it. Iâ€™m not ashamed that I trust people, that I care about them, that I think about them at 4 fucking AM and smile. I rather feel good because of this trait. This doesnâ€™t need fixing.\nIf you have struggled with low self-esteem, anxiety, or anything of that source youâ€™d know that loving yourself is hard. Loving is hard as hell when you arenâ€™t proud of how youâ€™ve acted in the past. Itâ€™s hard when you arenâ€™t the person you ought to become. I know what youâ€™re thinking, forgiving yourself is the answer, right? But is it that easy? Is it easy to forgive yourself? Certainly not. Forgiving others is way easier than forgiving yourself! But itâ€™s a continuous process. It constantly takes effort. You gotta keep trying no matter how many times you fail. The answer is not to forgive yourself once but to make it a habit.\nLet me ask you this, have you ever been in love? It doesnâ€™t just have to be romantic love, it could be platonic as well. Have you ever loved someone and been aware of it? Isnâ€™t it beautiful when all you want to talk about is this one fucking person? The one you think about before going to bed and waking up. Wouldnâ€™t it be heavenly to have someone love you like that? To think about you all the time, to care about you, to worry about you, to wish you all the happiness in this world for you and act like it? If youâ€™re lucky enough (which most of us arenâ€™t) you might end up getting that certain someone in your life. But miracles donâ€™t happen in this world. Youâ€™re probably not going to get someone like that.\nBut whatâ€™s the answer then?\nI know there are more questions in this entry than answers. But questions make you think and thinking brings conclusions.\nI like journaling. I like writing in general. Again, it makes you think hardâ€¦ This is just a place (apart from the physical journal I have) where I like to convert my messy thoughts into words. Or at least, I try to. The thing is my body aches while writing this. I observed people who I care about the most. I wanted them to ask me how I was doing. I wanted them to care about me. To worry about me. But that didnâ€™t go well ðŸŒš. Perhaps people just ask you how you are as a formality after youâ€™ve asked them this first.\nI learn something new every day and the more I learn, the less I trust people. Though I will not stop loving them, but I sure the hell will prioritize myself over them from now on. I mean wouldnâ€™t it just be beautiful if you were able to love yourself like someone you love the most? That includes forgiving yourself, being kind to yourself, taking care of yourself, accepting your flaws with open arms, and most importantly, valuing yourself over everyone else. I donâ€™t think that makes you selfish. Even if it does, itâ€™s only healthy.\n","wordCount":"803","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-06T13:49:56.168Z","dateModified":"2022-12-06T13:49:56.168Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Ali Raza"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://blog.0xali.com/posts/to-love-yourself-like-you-love-others/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Ali Raza","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://blog.0xali.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script>
